# iPhone Sync Script

The `iPhone Sync` executable is a program you can drag to your macOS doc.
Clicking it will:

- Trigger Finder to synchronise the iPhone of the given name (for now it is hardcoded)
- Trigger the `remove-recently-played` script from https://github.com/dylan-chong/itunes-applescripts
